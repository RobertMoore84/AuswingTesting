Introduction
This repository contains the necessary files and instructions to participate in the testing phase of the AusWing Explorer application. The goal is to test the accuracy and usability of the landmarking process used for identifying native bees based on wing venation.

Getting Started
You should have received a zip file containing 25 testing images. Please unzip these files into an easily accessible location on your device. Once ready, visit AusWing Explorer to begin the landmarking process.

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Logging In
Visit AusWing Explorer and log in using the credentials provided to you via email.
After logging in, you will see the option to begin landmarking.
Step 2: Uploading Images
Click the "Landmarking" button to navigate to the landmarking page.
Click "Choose File" to upload the first image from the unzipped folder. IMPORTANT: Please select the images in the order they appear in the folder.
Step 3: Applying CLAHE Filter
Once the image is uploaded, use the CLAHE filter to enhance the visibility of the wing venation if necessary.
Do not crop, rotate, or perform any other edits on the image.
Step 4: Landmarking
Place 14 landmarks on the wing image following the visual guide provided in this repository and on the website.
The landmarking order is crucial. Ensure that landmarks are placed in the correct sequence to ensure accurate predictions.
Step 5a: Identification Process
After placing the landmarks, click the "Start Identification" button.
Wait for the identification result. This may take between 5 to 25 seconds.
Once the result is displayed, you can move on to the next image.
Step 5b: Additional Landmarks (if required)
If prompted, place additional landmarks (up to 17) as instructed, and then click "Continue Prediction."
Step 6: Completion
After processing all images, your results will be automatically recorded on the website.
Important Notes
Please ensure that the landmarks are placed correctly, especially for landmarks 1 and 3, as these can vary slightly between images.
Use the CLAHE filter as needed to make the venation lines more visible.
